# Octave-wise Constant Q Transform (OCQT)

---

This folder contains the signal masking experiments done in the thesis.

- **masking_const_bin.m** runs a masking procedure on the glockenspiel signal using constant bin counts.
- **masking_dyn_bin.m** runs a masking procedure on the glockenspiel signal using dynamic bin counts.

Both scripts return spectrograms of the original signal, mask, and the resulting masked signal.

This repository is a complementary work for a graduate thesis in Applied Mathematics - University of the Philippines, Diliman entitled *An Octave-wise Constant Q Transform via Nonstationary Gabor Frames and Some Applications*.
