# Octave-wise Constant Q Transform (OCQT)

---

**Octave-wise Constant Q Transform (OCQT)** is a transformation capable of representing a signal with respect to a dynamic choice of frequency resolutions per octave. OCQT generalizes the Constant Q Transform (CQT) through the concept of nonstationary Gabor frames by introducing geometrically spaced frequency bins while maintaining, on each octave, a constant ratio of central frequencies to bandwidth, called the Q-factor.
